<font color=blue>**Q: Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs**</font>

A: **Interest rate = required rate of return, =discount rate, =opportunity costs.** An interest rate can be interpreted as the rate of return required in equalibrium for a particular investment, the discount rate for calculating the present value of future cash flows, or as opportunity cost of consuming now, rather than saving and investing.



<font color=blue>**Q: Explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk**</font>

A: The real risk-free rate is a theoretical rate on a single-period loan when there is no expectation of inflation. Normal risk-free rate = real risk-free rate + expected inflation rate.Â 

Securities may have several risks, and each increases the required rate of return. These include **default risk**, **liquidity risk**, and **maturity risk**. The required rate of return on a security = real risk-free rate + expected inflation + default risk premium + liquidity premium + maturity risk premium.
